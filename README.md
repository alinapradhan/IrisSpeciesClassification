The **Iris Species Classification** project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**.
The dataset, sourced from **scikit-learn**, consists of four key features: **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width**. The project begins with data preprocessing, 
ensuring no missing values and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted using visualizations like histograms and scatter plots 
to understand feature distributions and relationships. Several classification models, including **Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), 
Decision Tree, and Random Forest**, are trained and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. The best-performing model is selected for making predictions 
on new data. This project provides insights into multi-class classification and highlights the importance of model selection in achieving high accuracy.
